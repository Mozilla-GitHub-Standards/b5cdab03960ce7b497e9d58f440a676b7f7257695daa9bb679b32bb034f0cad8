Introduction
============

**Marteau** is based on `Funkload <http://funkload.nuxeo.org/>`_, which is a
functional and load web tester based on Python.

The main features of Funkload are:

- load tests are plain Python unit tests class
- everything can be run from the command-line
- you can run the load test locally or distributed across many nodes
- nice HTML reports are generated

**Marteau** is just a Redis-based queue that let you run distributed Funkload
load tests through the web.

**Marteau** features are:

- management of a list of nodes
- management of a list of workers
- enqueues load tests and drives Funkload to run them
- display successes, failures and Funkload reports


How to create a Marteau Load Test

Creating a load test for marteau is done in two steps:

- create a Funkload load test - composed of a module and a configuration file
- create a **.marteau.yml** file, that will be used by Marteau as the
  entry point.
